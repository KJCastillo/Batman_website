  <p>The BatFamily operates like a network of similarly-minded superheroes who operate in and around Gotham, with Batman as its head. The group usually are seen interacting with one another and assisting in each other's cases in their respective series. Although some members occasionally resent Batmanâ€™s intrusion into their lives, all respect him as a legend within the superhero community and rarely challenge him.</p>
